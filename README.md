# HaYidstream

sharing my setup of streaming from HA online streams with tamplate selects 

the main setup use 2  tampalte selects one for listing all available speakers excluding the unavailable and the unknown, the dropdown options are displaying the friendly_name and the status of ranch media_player 

the second select is hardcoded for live streams available on yiddish24

the select itself acts as the automation 

the seleatct uses templates to set the stream url titles and artwork

we then  uses some Helper inputs to save some info 

for cards we use auto entity cards that dynamically shows all players playing 

custum cards I have used for this setup are all avaliable in hacs


here are the list if cards used
